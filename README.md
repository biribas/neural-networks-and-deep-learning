# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository is based on the code from the book **[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)** by Michael Nielsen.

The original code was written for Python 2. This project updates and adapts that code to Python 3, with some improvements for readability, structure, and modern best practices (such as type hints, use of `numpy` more idiomatically, and vectorized operations).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `numpy`
